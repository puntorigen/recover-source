# Recover-Source :mag_right: :bulb:

Recover-source is a powerful CLI tool that brings your JS/TS source code back to life :sparkles:. Given a directory with minified/uglified .js or .ts files along with their respective source map files, recover-source revives the original files as they were before compilation. Turn the unreadable into the understandable!

## Installation :wrench:
```bash
npm i recover-source -g
```

You can also use this program via `npx` (packaged with NodeJS):
```bash
npx recover-source -i  <path-to-directory-with-minified-files>
```

And that's it! Recover-source is ready for action :rocket:!

## Usage :video_game: 
To use recover-source, simply provide it with a directory containing minified files:
```bash
recover-source -i <path-to-directory-with-minified-files>
```

... and watch as the original source code springs back into existence!
